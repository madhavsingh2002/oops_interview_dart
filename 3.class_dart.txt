In Dart, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). 
It encapsulates data for the object and methods to operate on that data. 
A class defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.

Defining a Class in Dart
To define a class in Dart, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces `{}`. 
Inside the curly braces, you can define fields, constructors, methods, and other members.

Example
Here is an example of a simple Dart class:

class Person {
  // Fields
  String name;
  int age;

  // Constructor
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  // Method
  void greet() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Creating an object of the Person class
  Person person = Person('Alice', 30);

  // Calling a method on the object
  person.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
}

Key Components
- Fields: Variables that hold the state of the object. In the example, `name` and `age` are fields.
- Constructor: A special method that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's fields. 
    `Person(this.name, this.age);` is a constructor.
- Methods: Functions defined within the class that describe the behaviors of the objects. 
    The `greet` method in the example prints a greeting message.

This basic structure allows you to create and manipulate objects in Dart, adhering to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
